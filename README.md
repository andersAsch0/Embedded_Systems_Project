WIP

This is a continuation of my final project for my embedded systems class, CS120B. I have decided to keep working on it and to convert it from an arduino into a microcontroller only and put it on a pcb. I then hope to cut all ties with my laptop and 3d print a case so that it is a fully usable product.

parts list:
chip: ATMEGA328P U (bootloader burned by me)
